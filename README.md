# neko-bot
A bot made for use on Discord to recommend a random manga on command

This bot specifically is made for use on my personal discord server to randomly recommend BL manga/manhwa to readers
but can otherwise be used in any other sort of "randomized recommendation" fashion.

Files not included:
- modules (node, discord, winston)
- lib.js: there is an array of strings in here with the recommendation data pre-formatted for easy access in neko.js
- auth.json: only has my discord bot token, which is the most important information

Not a very complicated or complex bot. The design and functionality is simple,
but I made it because there were no pre-existing bots that did what I wanted it to do, so I made my own.
